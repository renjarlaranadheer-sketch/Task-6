# Task-6

This project focuses on analyzing monthly sales trends using SQL to understand how revenue and order volume change over time. The dataset contains essential transaction details such as order ID, order date, order amount, and product ID. Using SQL aggregation techniques, the analysis extracts the year and month from each order date to generate meaningful monthly summaries.

The core query uses SUM(amount) to calculate the total monthly revenue and COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) to determine the unique order volume for each month. These results are grouped by year and month and sorted chronologically to produce a clear and structured sales timeline.

This analysis helps identify patterns such as seasonal trends, sales growth, and periods of high or low activity. It can be used for business reporting, forecasting, and performance evaluation. The SQL script included in this project covers table creation, inserting sample sales data, and running the final trend analysis query.

Overall, this project provides a simple yet effective approach to understanding monthly sales performance using SQL-based data aggregation. Let me know if you want this as a downloadable file!
